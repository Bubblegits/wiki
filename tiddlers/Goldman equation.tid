title: Goldman equation

Goldman equation is the key to understanding ions responsible for maintaining resting potential. K+ has far larger permibility than Na+ in resting condition, in this sense, we say K+ is responsible for the resting membrane potential. The resting potential is caused of efflux fo Na+, yet it is not maintained by Na+ since the membrane is not permable to it. When considering these questions, always start from a electrical neutral condition.
