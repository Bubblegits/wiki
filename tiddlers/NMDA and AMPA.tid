title: NMDA and AMPA

AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs and NMDARs) mediate excitatory synaptic transmission in the basal ganglia (and other regions?). NMDA receptors are commonly thought to play a role in the development of cortical circuitry, primarily as mediators of activity-dependent plasticity. AMPA receptors are commonly thought to play a role in normal, ongoing transmission between neurons.
