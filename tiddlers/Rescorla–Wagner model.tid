title: Rescorla–Wagner model

The Rescorla–Wagner model ("R-W") is a model of classical conditioning, in which learning is conceptualized in terms of associations between conditioned (CS) and unconditioned (US) stimuli. A strong CS-US association means that the CS signals predict the US.

{\displaystyle \Delta V_{X}} is the change in the strength, on a single trial, of the association between the CS labelled "X" and the US
𝛼{\displaystyle \alpha } is the salience of X (bounded by 0 and 1)
𝛽{\displaystyle \beta } is the rate parameter for the US (bounded by 0 and 1), sometimes called its association value
𝜆{\displaystyle \lambda } is the maximum conditioning possible for the US

{\displaystyle V_{X}} is the current associative strength of X

{\displaystyle V_{\mathrm {tot} }} is the total associative strength of all stimuli present, that is, X plus any others

The physiological basis of association strength (V) may be the firing rate of dopamine neurons, since it encodes prediction error.
